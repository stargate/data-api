# Data API Error Objects V2
#
# This file contain the error messages that are returned by the Data API
#
# The error descriptions in this file are ready by the APIException classes to create the content for the errors.
# That is, only errors defined in the code are read from this file, see the APIException class in the code
# for a description of how the errors are defined and manged.
#
# Errors have the following hierarchy:
# Family -> (optional) Scope -> Code
#
# Where
# * Family: Identifies if the error relates to the client request or the server processing, analogous
#           to the 4XX and 5XX HTTP status codes. Supported values are REQUEST or SERVER. In this file they are
#           represented by the request-errors and server-errors keys.
# * Scope: Optionally identifies the part of the request or server processing that caused the fault, for example "FILTER"
#          when there is a problem in the filter clause. Scope generally map to a concrete APIException class such as
#          FilterException.
# * Code: A unique string identifying the error.
#
# All values are strings and must be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_1 supporting upper case alpha and digits.
#
# FILE LAYOUT
# ===========
#
# "snippets" is a list of text snippets than can be included in any error body, the snippets are included in the
# variables when running the tempalte for the body of the error. Snippets are referenced using `${SNIPET.<NAME>}`
# where <NAME> is the name of the snippet key.
# Each snippet has:
# - name: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_1
# - body: A string with the text of the snippet, recommend using the `|-` to trim trailing newlines.
#
# "request-errors" and "server-errors" are lists of error objects, for the REQUEST and SERVER family respectively.
# Each error object has:
# - scope: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_1
# - code: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_1
# - http-status-override: (optional) The HTTP status code to return when this error is thrown. If not present, the
#                           default status code is 200 for most things. This is not returned in the error object JSON
#                           It is used to override the HTTP status code in the response.
#                           NOTE: NO checking is done to confirm this is a valid HTTP status code.
# - title: A short title for the error, that must not change between instances of the error.
# - body: A longer body that may contain ${vars} to be passed by the code when created, and references to snippets.
#         This can be a multi line string, recommend using the `|-` to trim trailing newlines.
#
# NOTE: Please keep the entries sorted on their name for snippets, or scope and code for errors. Please add a
#       new line after each entry, using the `|-` to trim trailing newlines.
