/**
 * Operations get data in and out of Cassandra. Some are very specific by find on doc by ID, or
 * insert one doc. Others may be more general like filtering by several text fields.
 *
 * <p>Operations may be able to push down to the database (this is good) but some will may need to
 * filter or sort in memory (not as good). In general good things are good.
 *
 * <p>Operations are built with all the data they need to execute, and only know about standard Java
 * types and our shredded document. That is they do not interact with JSON. As well as data they
 * also have all the behavior they need to implement the operation.
