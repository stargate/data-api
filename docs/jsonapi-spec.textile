h1. JSON API Query Specification

<span id="tableOfContents">

{toc:maxLevel=3}

</span>

h2(#preamble). Preamble

The target users for the JSON API are Javascript developers who interact with the service through a driver or Object Document Mapper (ODM) library such as "Mongoose":https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose. The nature of a JSON API lends itself to complex, structured queries that may express compound or multiple operations in a single request. Such as selecting one or more documents and projecting a selection of fields from each, or selecting one or more documents and updating them server side. We consider that most requests are generated via the ODM (for example via "mquery":https://github.com/aheckmann/mquery) which makes it easy for the developer to create complex queries at code time, or at run time in response to the actions taken by a user (such as which fields were updated, or which fields the user wants to see). The implementation of the JSON API should therefor be optimized for expressing complex and compound machine generated queries, rather than developers making direct queries via the wire protocol API.

The API should be implemented using HTTP 1 or 2 using JSON as the accepted and returned content type, however adherence to a design pattern such REST is not recommended. This is because of the above expected use through an ODM, and due to the complexity that can be expressed in the JSON API. The specification includes compound operations, such as find and update, to be implemented in the server which do not have a clear mapping to the REST verbs.

Additionally consideration should be given to implementing that API such that the body of a request can be machine generated and includes all possible information needed to process the request. With the exception of any out of band information such as authentication and possibly the collection name. This approach makes it easier to integrate the JSON API service with other data services though the use of templates or code to generate a request.

h2(#concepts). High Level Concepts

The JSON API consists of the following high level concepts that are composed to create a request:

* *Namespace:* A logical container representing a distinct storage location and query boundary which can contain multiple collections. May map to a keyspace or database.
* *Collection:* A logical container of documents that have some meaning to the developer using the API. Often an ODM may map a single developer defined class or type to a collection.
* *Document:* A document is a hierarchical "JSON":https://www.json.org/ document with a single reserved @_id@ field. All documents in a collection may have different fields and structure.
* *Command:* Commands are performed on Collections of Documents. Commands may return zero or more documents from the collection, update or insert zero or more documents, or both. 
* *Clause:* Clauses are included in operations to control or extend the behavior of an operation. Clauses may be required or optional for an operation, when optional a default behavior is expected.  

These concepts are grouped together to form a *Request* sent by client software for the API to process, the API responds with a response document whose format depends on the command being executed. Each request includes:

* The name of a collection of documents to execute against, a single request may only execute against a single collection. 
* A command to execute. 
* The required and optional clauses.
* Any out of band metadata such as authentication or tracing information. The nature of such out of band metadata is outside of the scope of this document.  

*TODO:* DO we need to have multiple commands in a single request? 

h2(#conventions). Conventions 

To aid in specifying the JSON API, we will use the following conventions in this document:

* Language rules will be given in a "BNF":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form -like notation:

bc(syntax). <start> ::= TERMINAL <non-terminal1> <non-terminal1>

* Nonterminal symbols will have @<angle brackets>@.
* As additional shortcut notations to BNF, we'll use traditional regular expression's symbols (@?@, @+@ and @*@) to signify that a given symbol is optional and/or can be repeated. We'll also allow parentheses to group symbols and the @[<characters>]@ notation to represent any one of @<characters>@.
* The grammar is provided for documentation purposes and leave some minor details out. 
* Sample code will be provided in a code block:

bc(sample). SELECT sample_usage FROM cql;

* References to keywords or API examples text will be shown in a @fixed-width font@. 

Samples of requests, operations, and clauses will be presented and encoded as a JSON document. This is illustrative of a suggested encoding as described in the "Preamble":#preamble   

h2(#messaging). Request and Response Messages

The format of Request and Response messages is included in this document so that the format invoking a command, and the structrure of it's response can be understood. 

h3(#messagingRequest). Request Messages

Request messages contain only a single command. Batch operations such as bulk loading are implementing using commands that support the inclusion of multiple documents in the command. The request message is a single JSON document (a JSON Object) that represents the command to run.

p. _Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<request-message> ::=  <command-name> <command>

p. @<command-name>@ and @<command>@ are defined later in this document document. 

p. _Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
{"find" : {
    "filter" : {"name": "aaron"},
    "projection" : {"name": 1, :"age" : 1}
    } 
} 

p. Top level names in the request message other than a command name are ignored, except where specified in this document.

h3(#messagingResponse). Response Messages

A single JSON format is used for all response messages, though different elements may be present depending on the command. 

p. _Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<response-message> ::=  (errors (<error>)+)?,    
                        (status (<command-status>)+)?, 
                        (data <response-data>)?,

<<error> ::= message <ascii-string>, 
             errorCode <ascii-string>,
                    (<error-field>)*
<error-field> ::= <error-field-name> <error-field-value>
<error-field-name> ::= <json-string>
<error-field-value> ::= <json-value>

<command-status> ::= <command-status-name> <command-status-value>
<command-status-name> ::= <json-string>
<command-status-value> ::= <json-value>

<response-data> ::= docs (<document>)*, 
                    (nextPageState <page-state>)?,
                    (count <document-count>)?
<page-state> ::= <ascii-string>
<document-count> ::= <positive-integer>

p. The contents of the @<response-message>@ depend on the command, in general though: 

* A successful command to read documents *must* have @<response-data>@ and *may* have @<command-status>@ or @<error>@. 
* A successful command to insert or update data that does not return documents *must* have one or more @<command-status>@. 
* A successful command to insert or update data that returns documents *must* have one or more @<command-status>@ and *must* have @<response-data>@.
* An unsuccessful command *must* have one or more @<error>@'s and may have other items.

Error information or additional status, such as the @_id@s of inserted documents, is included by some commands. 

Error responses include one or more @<error>@ under the @error@ name. Error info must include a @message@ intended for humans, a @errorCode@ intended for machines to process, and may include other information.   

@<command-status>@ information generally describes the side effects of commands, such as the number of updated documents or the @_id@s of inserted documents.

@<response-data>@ contains zero or more documents returned from the command, if present @<page-state>@ indicates further results are available. See command details for information on how to use the page state. 

p. _find Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
{
    "data" : {
        "docs" : [
            {"username" : "aaron"}
        ] 
    }
} 

p. _insertMany Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
{
    "status" : {
        insertedIds : ["doc1", "doc2", "doc3"]
    }
} 

p. _insertOne with error Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
{
    "errors" : [
        {"message": "_id cannot be Null", "errorCode" : "ID_NULL"}
    ]
} 

h2(#namespace). Namespace

*TODO:* define the namespace, it's properties etc . Do we define how to create one ?

h3(#namespaceLimits). Namespace Limits

h4(#namespaceLimitsName). Namespace Name Limit

Namespace names must follow the regular expression pattern below:

_Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<namespace-name> ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

p. The maximum length of a namespace name is 48 characters. 

h2(#collection). Collection

*TODO:* define the collection, it's properties etc . Do we define how to create one ? 

h3(#collectionLimits). Collection Limits

h4(#collectionLimitsName). Collection Name Limit

Collection names must follow the regular expression pattern below:

_Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<collection-name> ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

p. The maximum length of a collection name is 48 characters. 

h2(#document). Documents 

*TODO:* Describe how do we define a document and then refer to the parts of a JSON document, e.g. key or path etc ?  

h3(#documentFieldNames). Field Names

Fields names in the JSON document have additional restrictions not imposed on the "member names" by the "JSON Specification":https://www.json.org/. These restrictions are to ensure compatiblity with the underlaying storage system.

Fields names must adhere to the ASCII character set (though may be encoded using UTF-8) and follow the regular experession below. The field name @_id@ is the only field name that can be used that does not match the rules for user defined field names.

_Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<field-name> ::= <id-field-name> |
                <user-field-name> 

<id-field-name> = _id
<user-field-name> ::= [a-zA-Z0-9_]+

p. The @_id@ field is a "reserved name" and is always interpreted as the document identity field. See *TODO DOC ID LINK* for restrictions on it's use. 

*TODO* add support for allowing "." and "$" in the field names, not needed for the intitial demo release. 

p. _Sample:_ 

bc(sample).. 
{
    "_id" : "my_doc",
    "a_field" : "the value", 
    "sub_doc" : {
        "inner_field" : 1
    },
    "__v" : 1
}

h3(#documentArrayIndexes). Array Indexes

Array indexes are used in query paths to identify elements in a array. They are zero based, and *must* not include leading zeros, i.e. @1@ is a legal array index and @0001@ is not. Leading zeros are not legal numbers in the "JSON Specification":https://www.json.org/ and should only be used as a property of an object. Not that the first element in the array is indexed using a single zero @0@.

_Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<array-index> ::= ^0$|^[1-9][0-9]*$

p. _Sample:_ 

bc(sample).. 
// Second element of the `tags` array is equal to "foo"
{"find" : {
    "filter" : {"tags.2": "foo"}
    }
} 
// Filter on the first element of the tags array
{"find" : {
    "filter" : {"tags.0": "foo"}
    }
} 

h3(#documentPaths). Document Paths

Document paths are used to identify fields in a JSON document in multiple contexts, such as a filter for a query or specifying fields to update.

@<document-path>@ in this specification are a "JSON Path":https://jsonpath.com/ like syntax. 

"Clauses":#clauses specify where they support the use of @<document-path>@ to filter, update, sort, or project documents.  

_Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<document-path> ::= <dotted-notation-path> 

h4(#documentPathsDottedNotation). Dotted Notation Paths

Dotted Notation Paths support specifying top level fields, fields in embedded documents (nested fields), array elements, and nested structures in arrays.

In general the dotted notation is one or more @<field-name>@ or @<array-index>@ concatenated with a period characher @.@ and no additional whitespace.

_Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<dotted-notation-path> ::= <field-name>(.<field-name> | <array-index>)*

p. _Sample:_ 

bc(sample).. 
// _id is equal to 1 
{"find" : {
    "filter" : {"_id": 1}
    }
} 
// suburb field in the address sub document is equal to "banana"
{"find" : {
    "filter" : {"address.suburb": "banana"}
    }
} 
// Second element of the `tags` array is equal to "foo"
{"find" : {
    "filter" : {"tags.2": "foo"}
    }
} 

h3(#documentLimits). Document Limits

JSON documents must ahere to the following limits. Attempting to insert or modify a document beyond these limits will result in the command failing. 

h4(#documentLimitsSize). Document Size Limit

The maximum size of a single document is 1 megabyte. The size is determined by the JSON serialisation of the document. 

h4(#documentLimitsDepth). Document Depth Limit

The maximum nesting depth for a single document is 8 levels deep. Each nested docment or array adds another level. 

h4(#documentLimitsFields). Document Field Limits

The maximum length of a "field name":#documentFieldNames is 48 characters. 

The maximum number of fields allowed in a single JSON object is 64. 

h4(#documentLimitsValues). Document Value Limits

The maxium size of field values are:

|_. JSON Type |_. Maximum Value |
| @string@ | Maximum length of 16384 unicode characters |
| @number@ | TODO: define max num that is well handled by BigDecimal |

h4(#documentLimitsArray). Document Array Limits

The maximum length of an array is 100 elements. 

h2(#commands). Commands

Commands are included in a request and are executed against a single collection. 

Each command specifies one or more "Clauses":#clauses that control how it operates, and may include set of options to further modify behavior. 

The following commands are supported for collections: 

* "@countDocuments@":#commandCountDocuments
* "@deleteMany@":#commandDeleteMany
* "@deleteOne@":#commandDeleteOne
* "@estimatedDocumentCount@":#commandEstimatedDocumentCount
* "@find@":#commandFind
* "@findOne@":#commandFindOne
* "@findOneAndUpdate@":#commandFindOneAndUpdate
* "@insertMany@":#commandInsertMany
* "@insertOne@":#commandInsertOne
* "@updateMany@":#commandUpdateMany
* "@updateOne@":#commandUpdateOne

Each command always results in a single "response":#commandResponses , unless there is an unecpected exception. See the "JSON API HTTP Specification" for details. 

Commands are defined using the BNF like syntax, with samples presented using a "JSON":https://www.json.org/ encoding of the language. The use of JSON in these samples does not preclude other encodings of the API in the future.

p. _Sample:_ 

bc(sample).. 
// select all documents in a collection, return complete documents
{"find" : {} }

// select where name == "aaron" and return selected fields
{"find" : {
    "filter" : {"name": "aaron"},
    "projection" : {"name": 1, :"age" : 1}
    } 
}

    } 
} 

h4(#commandFindOrderOfOperation). find Command Order of Operations

p. TODO: add how cursor state fits into the processing 

@find@ commands are processed using the following order of operation: 

# @<filter-clause>@ is applied to the collection to select *candidate set* of documents, if no @<filter-clause>@ is supplied all documents in the collection are candidate documents.  
# @<sort-clause>@ is applied to the candidate documents to order them, if no @<sort-clause>@ is supplied the documents sort order is undefined.
# The @limit@ option from @<find-command-options>@ is applied to reduce the number of candidate documents to no more than @limit@, if no @limit@ is supplied all candidate documents are included. 
# @<projection-clause>@ is applied to each candidate document to create the *result set* documents to be included in the @<find-command-response>@, if no @<projection-clause>@ is specified the complete candidate documents are included in the response.

h3(#commandFindOneAndUpdate). findOneAndUpdate Command


@findOneAndUpdate@ selects one document from a collection using a match filter that is updated by the server using an atomic transaction, either all the changes described in the @<update-document-clause>@ are stored or none of them are (further details of the transaction requirements below). It then returns a projection of either the document before or after the update has been applied.

_Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<find-one-and-update-command> ::= findOneAndUpdate <find-one-and-update-command-payload> 
<find-one-and-update-command-response> ::= <single-document-response>

| @upsert@ | Boolean | When @true@ if no documents match the @filter@ clause the command will create a new _empty_ document and apply the @update@ clause to the empty document. If the @_id@ field is included in the @filter@ the new document will use this @_id@, otherwise a random value will be used see "Upsert Considerations":#considerationsUpsert for details. When false the command will only update a document if one matches the filter. Defaults to @false@.|

h4(#commandUpdateOneResponse). updateOne Command Response

|_. Response Element |_. Description |
| @data@ | Not present. |
| @status@ |Present with fields: @matchedCount@ count of documents that matched the @filter@ (no more than 1), @modifiedCount@ count of document updated (may be less than match count, no more than 1), @upsertedId@ if a document was upserted (when @matchCount@ is zero) otherwise not present. |
| @errors@ |Present if errors occur. |

If an error occurs the command will still return @status@ as some documents may have been inserted. 

h2(#commandConsierations). Command Considerations

Additional considerations that apply to multiple commands. 

h3(#considerationsUpsert). Upsert Considerations

Multiple concurrent requests that use upsert may result in multiple documents created when the intention was to only create one. This is because the default behaviour of upsert is to create a new document with a random, server assigned, @_id@ and then apply the updates to that document. 

If the @filter@ clause of the command includes the @_id@ field when performing an upsert the new document will use the supplied @_id@. This will ensure a single document is created, as the @_id@ is unique. Overlapping commands may read the new document and update it. 

Fields included in the filter clause in addition to the @_id@ are ignored. 

h3(#considerationsMultiDocumentFailure). Multi Document Failure Considerations

Commands that modify multiple documents in a single operation, such as @updateMany@ or @insertMany@, do not perform all of the modification in a single transaction. Instead each document is updated individually and concurrently with other modifications and reads. As a consequence there are two failure modes for multi document updates, and each command specifies if it supports one, or both. 

The two failure modes are "Fail Fast" and "Fail Silently". Where the main different is Fail Fast commands normally return results about individual documents, and Fail Silent commands normally return a summary or count of affected document.

There are two category of storage failures under consideration: 

# *Availability Faults*: These occur when the underlying storage platform is unable to successfully complete an operation due node failures. These errors may be transient and the JSON API may retry operations, if operations still fail after retrying the operation will be considered to have failed. 
# *Concurrency Faults*: These occur when the a document is under very high concurrenct modification which make it impossible for the JSON API to complete an optimistic "compare-and-set" update. Modification operations read documents from the storage platform and update or delete it only if it has not changed since being read. If the document has changed, the filter that seleted the document is tested again on that document, and the modification is re-tried. Under high contention it is possible for one request to "starve" and be unable to complete.     

In the context of Multi Document Failures we consider a failure (after a configured number of retries) from either of these categories as a failure to complete a command.  

The server should use the following retry policy: 
* *Availability Faults*: a single retry, for a total of two (2) attempts.
* *Concurrency Faults*: two retries, for a total of three (3) attempts.  

*Note* Neither of these faults will leave a document in an inconsistent state, that would cause "eventually consistent" reads. Document retain internal consistency as they are stored on a single row which is always atomically updated. And they maintain cluster wide consistency through the user of cluster wide "compare-and-set" operations.    

h4(#considerationsMultiDocumentFailureFailFast). Fail Fast Multi Document Failure

Under the "fail fast" mode each operation on the database is performed sequentially, ensuring the previous operation has succedded before starting the next. In this mode a single failure causes the command to stop processing and return information on the work that has completed together with an error. 

For example, consider an ordered "@insertMany@":#commandInsertMany command that is inserting three documents. This command will use "fail fast", the second document will be inserted once the first is successful. If inserting the second document fails the command will return both the @_id@ of the first document and an error describing the failure inserting the second. No attempt will be made to insert the third document. 

h4(#considerationsMultiDocumentFailureFailSilently). Fail Silently Multi Document Failure

Under the "fail silently" mode the command will attempt to perform all operations on the database, which may include successfully processing some operations after others have failed. In this mode a single failure does not cause the command to stop processing, instead it makes a best effort to complete and returns information on the work that was completed and potentially what was not. 

Fail silently also allows the server to re-order the database operations to achieve best performance, which may include running multiple operations in parallel. 

Commands that use Fail Silently may return an error(s) and status information about what was successfully completed. See "Response Messages":#messagingResponse for the structure of responses, and "Commands":#commands for individual command responses. Multiple errors may be returned, the server should rationalise the errors by category. e.g. it should not return 10 errors that each say "DB service timeout", rather it should return a single error that covers the 10 documents this happened to.  

For example, consider an **unordered** "@insertMany@":#commandInsertMany command that is inserting three documents. This command will use "fail silently", and may run all database operations at once in parallel. If inserting the second document fails, the first and third may success. In this case command will return the @_id@ of the first and third documents and an error describing the failure inserting the second. 

Similarly a "@deleteMany@":#commandDeleteMany  command always uses "fail silently", and will attempt to delete many candidate documents in parallel. If an Availability or Concurrency fault occurs the command will retry the operation some configured number of times before marking that document operation as failed. At completion the command will return a count of deleted documents and an error describing any failures.

p. A @<filter-expression>@ may either apply to a node in the document identified by a path (@<filter-comparison-expression>@), or be a logical expression that evaluates the result of sub expressions (@<filter-logical-expression>@).

A (@<filter-comparison-expression>@) identifies a *context node* in the document using a @<document-path>@. The context node, including the value, name, type, document path, and any other meta data, may then tested by the expression. If the expression specifies a @<literal>@ then the value of the node is tested using an @$eq@ operation. Otherwise the expression will specify one @<filter-operator-expression>@ which defines one or more @<filter-operation>@'s which must all evaluate to @True@ for the @<filter-operator-expression>@ to evaluate to @True@.

_Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
// Comparison expression using a literal value
{“name” : “aaron”}
// Comparison expression using a single operator expression, equivalent to the previous example
{“name” : {“eq” : “aaron”}}
// Comparison expression using a single and a multiple operator expression
{“name” : {“eq” : “aaron”}, "age" : {"$gt" : 40, "$lt" : 50}}
// Comparison expression testing metadata about the context node 
{"name" : {"$exists" : False}}


p. The @<document-path>@ may fail to select a context node, either for all documents in the collection or only some. Whenever this happens a "Missing" context node is evaluated by the @<filter-operation>@'s as the operations may handle a missing context node differently. For example @$eq@ and @$ne@ have opposite behavior, see the operation descriptions below for details.

A @<filter-operation>@ is an operation on the context node identified by the expression. The node provides the Left Hand Side (LHS) operand of the operation, while the definition provides the operator and Right Hand Side (RHS) operand (if required). All @<filter-operation>@ *must* evaluate to either @True@ or @False@. 

The other form of @<filter-expression>@ is a @<filter-logical-expression>@ which applies a logical operation to a list of sub @<filter-expression>@'s. As such this type of expression does not specify a context node for operations to be evaluated. 

_Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
// Logical expression using a literal value and single operator expressions
{ "$and" : [{“name” : “aaron”}, {"age" : {"$gt" : 40}}]}
// Note, there is an implicit $and operator for all top level expressions, so this is equivalent 
{{“name” : “aaron”}, {"age" : {"$gt" : 40}}}
// Logical expression using multiple operator expressions
{ "$or" : [{“name” : {“eq” : “aaron”}}, {"age" : {"$gt" : 40}}]}

h4(#clauseFilterOrderOfOperation). Filter Clause Order of Operations

The filter clause is made up of zero or more expressions that evaluate to @True@ or @False@. 

The @<filter-clause>@ is evaluated using the following order of operations:  

# If the filter clause has zero expressions then all documents in the collection are selected.
# If the filter clause has a single @<filter-expression>@ then all documents in the collection where the expression evaluates to @True@ are selected.
# If the filter clause has more than one top level @<filter-expression>@ then all documents in the collection where all expressions evaluate to @True@ are selected.


h4(#comparisonOperationLiteral). @<literal>@ comparison

A literal comparison operation performs the @$eq@ operation on the context node using the supplied literal value. See "$eq":#comparisonOperationEq for the definition. 

h4(#comparisonOperationEq). $eq operation

@$eq@ applies a type sensitive equals operation to the value context node and the @<literal>@ operand. 

_Note:_ This version of the specification only defines equality for atomic values such as string or a number. It does not support equality between arrays or sub documents. 

@$eq$@ evaluates to @True@ when all of the following conditions are @True@: 

# The context node exists.
# The type of the context node value matches the type of the operand, i.e. string can be compared to string, or number to number. However a number cannot be compared to a string.
# The value of the node is equal to the @<literal>@ operand. String comparisons use string binary comparison i.e. it is sensitive to case and other modifiers.

h4(#comparisonOperationGt). $gt operation

TODO: node must exist

h4(#comparisonOperationGte). $gte operation

TODO: node must exist

h4(#comparisonOperationLt). $lt operation

TODO: node must exist

h4(#comparisonOperationLte). $lte operation

TODO: node must exist

h4(#comparisonOperationNe). $ne operation

@$ne@ applies a type sensitive not-equals operation to the value of the context node and the @<literal>@ operand. 

_Note:_ This version of the specification only defines equality for atomic values such as string or a number. It does not support equality between arrays or sub documents. 

@$ne$@ evaluates to @True@ when *either* of the following conditions are @True@: 

# The context node does not exist.
# The type of the context node value is different to the type of the operand.
# The value of the node is not-equal to the @<literal>@ operand. String comparisons use string binary comparison i.e. it is sensitive to case and other modifiers.

h4(#comparisonOperationIn). $in operation

@$in@ applies to context node values that are either atomic or an array, in either case the RHS operand is a list of literals. The operation tests if the value of the context node is present in the RHS operand.

When the value of the context node is atomic, @$in@ evaluates to @True@ when all of the following conditions are @True@: 

# The context node exists
# @$eq@ evaluates to @True@ for any pair of the node value and a value from the RHS operand list. 

When the value of the context node is an array, @$in@ evaluates to @True@ when all of the following conditions are @True@: 

# The context node exists
# @$eq@ evaluates to @True@ for any pair of a value from the node array or value in the RHS operand.

h4(#comparisonOperationNin). $nin operation

@$nin@ applies to context node values that are either atomic or an array, in either case the RHS operand is a list of literals. The operation tests if the value of the context node is not present in the RHS operand.

When the value of the context node is atomic, @$nin@ evaluates to @True@ when *either* of the following conditions are @True@: 

# The context node does not exist.
# @$eq@ evaluates to @False@ for all pairs of the node value and a value from the RHS operand list. 

When the value of the context node is an array, @$nin@ evaluates to @True@ when *either* of the following conditions are @True@: 

# The context node does not exist
# @$eq@ evaluates to @False@ for all pairs of a value from the node array and a value in the RHS operand.

h4(#logicalOperationNot). $not operation

@$not@ applies a logical _Not_ to a @<filter-operator-expression>@, which is evaluated against the context node identified by the @<filter-comparison-path>@ of hte comparison express. While @$not@ is logical operation it behaves differently to @$and@, @$or@, and @$nor@ as they apply logical operations to the results of 1 or more sub @<filter-expression>@ while @$not@ applies to a single @<filter-operator-expression>@. 

_Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
// Applying $not to an $eq operation
{“name” : {"$not" : {“eq” : “aaron”}}}


p. Note that the behavior of @$not@ when the context node does not exist means that it can change the behavior of operations and should not always be considered a logical opposite. 

@$not$@ evaluates to @True@ when *either* of the following conditions are @True@: 

# The context node does not exist.
# The result of evaluating the RHS @<filter-operator-expression>@ is @False@.

The performance of applying @$not@ to a multi-clause @<filter-operator-expression>@ will often be slower than constructing a @<filter-operator-expression>@ that uses operations that directly express the test. This is because the @<filter-operation>@'s in the @<filter-operator-expression>@ are joined with a logical AND, meaning only one operation has to fail for the whole expression to fail allowing the expression to fail before testing all operations. In contrast applying NOT to the output of the @<filter-operator-expression>@ means that all operations must be tested (and evaluate to TRUE) for document to be excluded. 

h4(#elementOperationExists). $exists operation

@$exists@ applies to the metadata of the context node, to test if it exists. The RHS operand is a boolean value that controls the return value of the operation. 

_Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
// Select documents that have a name
{“name” : {"$exists" : true}}
// Select documents that do not have a name
{“name” : {"$exists" : false}}


p. @$exists@ evaluates to @True@ when all of the following conditions are @True@: 

# The context node exits. 
# The value of the RHS operand is @true@.

h3(#clauseProjection). Projection Clause 

A Projection clause is applied to zero or more input documents to project all of part of each document into an output document. Each input document maps to a single output document, although each output document may have a different document layout. For example when an input document is missing a projected field it will not appear in the output document. 

p. _Syntax:_

@TODO: this is $ in projection, not sure if mquery supports this
<projection-array-limit-projection> ::= $


p. Each @<projection-clause>@ is contains zero or more @<projection-expression>@'s which are all applied to each input document in an order decided by the server. The output of all @<projection-expression>@'s evaluated for a single input document create a single output document. 


h4(#clauseProjectionOrderOfOperation). Projection Clause Order of Operations

The @<projection-clause>@ is evaluated using the following order of operations:  

# If the projection clause is missing or empty the entire input document is selected for the output document. 
# Each @<projection-expression>@ is evaluated against the input document in an undefined order. The output is mapped to a field with the same path as the @<projection-field-path>@ for the expression. 
# Unless excluded via a @<projection-field-expression>@ the @<_id>@ field is included in the output document. 

h4(#projectionFieldExpression). @<projection-field-expression>@

@<projection-field-expression>@ is the simplest form of expression. It  identifies a field using a @<document-path>@ and includes or specifically excludes it from the output. Note that for any @<projection-clause>@ other than the identity clause any fields not listed are excluded from the output document. The @<projection-field-expression>@ includes a field using @1@ or @true@ and excludes it using @0@ or @false@. See "Projection Clause Order of Operations":#clauseProjectionOrderOfOperation for special treatment of the @_id@ field.

p. _Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
// Identity projection, selects the entire document 
{}
// Select top level and lower level fields 
{ "name" : 1, "address.country" : true}
// Select top level and lower level fields and exclude the _id 
{ "name" : 1, "address.country" : true, "_id": 0}

When the @<document-path>@ does not exist in the input document: 

# The output document will not include a field with that key. 

When the @<document-path>@ does exist in the input document: 

# If @<projection-field-inclusion>@ is @1@ or @true@ the key and it's entire value (including a sub-document if present) will be included in the output document. 
# If @<projection-field-inclusion>@ is @0@ or @false@ the output document will not include a field with that key


h4(#projectionElemMatchExpression).  @<projection-array-elem-match-projection>@ $elemMatch

*TODO:* confirm this is supported by mquery, not in the docs - should be supported, cannot see where 

h4(#projectionArraySliceExpression).  $slice

@<projection-array-slice-projection>@ is used to select a 1 or more elements from a source document array for the output document based on their position in the array. The element and any sub document are all selected. The @slice@ expression has three forms based on the parameters passed. 

Regardless of the supplied parameters @<projection-array-slice-projection>@ has the following behavior: 

# If the input document does not contain the node specified by the @<projection-field-path>@ the field is not selected for the output document. 
# If the input node does exist, and is not an array the field is not selected for the output document. 

If only @<slice-number>@ is supplied and the value is a positive integer then: 

# If the size of the array is less than or equal to the @<slice-number>@ the entire array is selected for the output document. 
# If the size of the array is greater than the @<slice-number>@ then the first @<slice-number>@ elements of the array are selected for the output in array order.


If only @<slice-number>@ is supplied and the value is a negative integer then: 

# If the size of the array is less than or equal to the @absolute(<slice-number>)@ the entire array is selected for the output document. 
# If the size of the array is greater than the @<slice-number>@ then the last @<slice-number>@ elements of the array are selected for the output in array order.
 
If only @<slice-number>@ is supplied and the value is a zero then:

# The field is selected for the output document as a zero length array. 

If both @<slice-to-skip>@ and @<slice-to-return>@ are supplied then: 

# If @<slice-to-skip>@ is a positive integer and greater than or equal to the size of the input array an empty array is returned. 
# If @<slice-to-skip>@ is a positive integer and less than the size of the input array it is the number of elements to skip before selecting elements. For a 0 based array a value of 1 indicates elements should be selected starting at the second element at index 1.
# If @<slice-to-skip>@ is a negative integer and it's absolute value is greater than or equal to the size of the input array the starting position is the start of the array. 
# If @<slice-to-skip>@ is a negative integer and it's absolute value is less than the size of the input array, it is the number of elements to skip backwards from the end of the array. For a 0 based array a value of -1 indicates elements should be selected starting with the last element.
# @<slice-to-return>@ indicates the number of elements to return after skipping @<slice-to-skip>@. 

p. _Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
// With the input array ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
// Select first 2 elements ["foo", "bar"]
{"$slice" : 2}
// Select last 2 elements ["bar", "baz"]
{"$slice" : -2}
// Select one element starting at second ["bar"]
{"$slice" : [1,1]}
// Select the last element, same as -1 ["baz"]
{"$slice" : [-1,1]}

h3(#clauseSort). Sort Clause 

A sort clause is applied to a set of documents to order them. Examples of this include ordering a large result set that will returned as pages, or sorting a candidate set of documents to determine which document will be returned when only a single document is required.   

*TODO* THis is wrong, it needs to be a map 

p. _Syntax:_

bc(syntax).. 
<sort-clause> ::= [<sort-expression>*]

<sort-expression> ::= (-)?<document-path>

p. Each @<sort-clause>@ contains an ordered list of @<sort-expression>@'s which are used to sort a candidate set of documents. The order of @<sort-expression>@'s is important and should be preserved as the request is transmitted and processed.

Each @<sort-expression>@ identifies a field in the document to sort by. By default the field values are sorted in ascending order, if the field name is prefixed with a @-@ the field is sorted in descending order. A maximum of *TODO* number of @<sort-expression>@'s may be included in a @<sort-clause>@.

p. _Sample:_

bc(sample).. 
// Sort by one field ascending
["name"]
// Sort by one field descending, and a second ascending 
["-age", "name"]

h4(#clauseSortOrderOfOperation). Sort Clause Order of Operations

The @<sort-clause>@ is evaluated using the following order of operations:

# If the sort clause is missing or contains zero @<sort-expression>@'s the order of candidate documents is unchanged, and is assumed to be the _natural order_ applied by the underlying database.
# If the @<sort-clause>@ contains a single @<sort-expression>@ the candidate documents are ordered by that field using the "Sort Order":#clauseSortOrder. If two or more documents have equivalent value for a field, the order of the documents will be natural order. 
# If the @<sort-clause>@ contains two or more @<sort-expression>@'s the first expression is used to sort the documents, and the second is used to sort all documents that have the same value for the first expression. A third @<sort-expression>@ is used to sort documents with a duplicate value for the second expression and so on.
